HI sir, you said that we should practice coding every day atleast for one hour. But we will be learning almost three programming languages at the end of second year.
So,what language should we focus on in that one hour..? or if we practice one language each day, like day1- python, day 2- c, day3 - java,what if on the fourth day i forgot a bit of phthon..? 
in which way i should practice sir..?
